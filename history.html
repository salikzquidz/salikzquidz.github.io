      <h1>History</h1>

      <p>
        In 1961, a limited number of organizations around the world—such as the International Union for the Conservation
        of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) and The Conservation Foundation—were trying to meet conservation needs,
        but were desperately short of funds.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first call for broad support was the Morges Manifesto, signed in 1961 by 16 of the world’s leading conservationists,
        including biologist and African wildlife enthusiast Sir Julian Huxley, IUCN vice president Sir Peter Scott
        and director-general of the British Nature Conservancy E. M. Nicholson. The Morges Manifesto stated that while
        the expertise to protect the world environment existed, the financial support to achieve this protection did not.
        The decision was made to establish World Wildlife Fund as an international fundraising organization to work in
        collaboration with existing conservation groups and bring substantial financial support to the conservation movement
        on a worldwide scale.
